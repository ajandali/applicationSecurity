# Answers and Thought process
This readme file explains my answers and thought process behind each one of them

**Question 1** 

was answered by having the owasp top 10 in my mind, i looked for technical vulnerabilities as i was checking for exploits and flaws on the webapp and api endpoints and the only tool i used was burp suite.

**Question 2** 

I have put few simple things in my mind when i was reviewing the code and those were, input validation and sanitation, hardcoded secrets/passwords and then i started looking for anything similar to what i have pre detertmined in my mind before reading the codes.

**Question 3** 

For the threat modeling exercise i have thought about including all threat actors that are external and internal, i have included also threats that are simply threats like an employee betraying the company and leaks info for a profit, so the threats i thought of werent purely about the webapp and its components.

**Question 4** 

I wrote a simple code that curls websites and looks for the most common security headers, in my mind i had an idea about the basic security for a website would be https and the http security headers so i simply used curl and put it in a python script.
